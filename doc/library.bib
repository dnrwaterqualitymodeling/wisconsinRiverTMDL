	volume = {53},
	issn = {0001-2351},
	abstract = {Phosphorus transfer from agricultural soils to surface waters is an important environmental issue. Commonly used models like {SWAT} have not always been updated to reflect current understanding of soil P transformations and transfer to runoff The objective of this study was to validate the ability of routines in both {SWAT}2000 and {SWAT}2005 to initialize the quantity of P in different P pools (and thus soil total P) and simulate changes in the simulated solution P pool. Based on data from 40 published studies, results show that currently published equations to estimate the soil {PSP} parameter and {SWAT}'s method of summing four soil P pools underpredict soil total P An underprediction of soil total could result in underprediction of P loss in runoff with eroded sediment. Conversely, the proposed alternative for estimating soil total P, which includes a new equation to estimate the soil {PSP} parameter and includes the solution P pool when summing soil P pools, resulted in accurate predictions of soil total P for 484 topsoil samples from 35 published studies. Results also show that both the {SWAT} routines and the routines proposed by a previous study for simulating changes in soil P were able to accurately predict long-term changes in soil solution P However, routines in both {SWAT}2000 and {SWAT}2005 may underpredict solution P for several weeks after P is added to soils. This could result in underprediction of dissolved inorganic P loss in runoff soon after a P application to soils. The routines proposed by the previous study would not result in similar underpredictions.},
