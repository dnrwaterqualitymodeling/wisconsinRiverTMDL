\subsection{Discharge}
Observed data for discharge were obtained from USGS in late September.

\subsubsection{Iterative calibration notes}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Calibrated monthly flows by allowing basin snow parameters to vary
	]across their full range. Iterated 2000 times. Used PBIAS to select best
	fit.
	Resulting snowfall temperature parameter initially was fit to an unrealistic
	value of -10 degrees C.
	\item Calibrating peak flows
		\begin{itemize}
		  \item We calibrated peak flows by adjusting only parameters that control
		  runoff and fitting to observed high streamflow data. During this phase of
		  calibrations, we adjusted the following parameters:
		  \begin{itemize}
		    \item CN2
		    \item SURLAG
		    \item SMTMP
		    \item SFTMP
		    \item WET_MXVOL
		    \item WET_PVOL
		    \item PND_EVOL
		    \item PND_PVOL
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
