	\subsubsection{Calibration software}
The primary software used for calibrating flows (discharge) and in-stream
pollutants was SWAT-CUP 2012, SWAT Calibration and Uncertainty Programs (see
``SWAT-CUP'' folder in ``SWAT-General'' folder in the e\textunderscore Library).
This software offers the capability to run several different analysis routines;
SUFI-2 is the routine that will be used in this project.
