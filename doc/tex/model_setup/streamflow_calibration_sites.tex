\subsubsection{Streamflow calibration sites}\label{sec:streamflow_calibration_sites}

Streamflow will be calibrated to daily discharge data aggregated to monthly mean using data from USGS gaging stations throughout the WRB. Subbasins in the WRB SWAT model were delineated at the pour point of each USGS gage site. Table \ref{tab:streamflow_calibration_sites} lists the gages that were used for various subbasins and the years of data that will be used for calibration. Not all gages within the WRB will be used as calibration points. The discharge records for all gages will be analyzed to only include sites where discharge was not regulated or affected by human development. Gages that exhibited an altered hydrograph will not be used for calibration.
