\subsubsection{Crop Rotations}

The generalized rotations were entered into a database where each activity was stored for the 6 year
period. In total 15 rotations (11 dairy, 3 cash grain, and 1 potato/vegetable) were created for the WRB,
based on the data from the CDL, information from county and regional staff, NASS census data, and
information from our meeting with agronomists. Each of the 15 rotations had three
variations, resulting in 45 rotations that were incorporated into the SWAT model \citep{wdnr_landcover_2014}.
