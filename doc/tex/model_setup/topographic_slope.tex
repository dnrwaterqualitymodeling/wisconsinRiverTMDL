\subsection{Slope Classification}\label{sec:slope}

Topographic features are characterized at the subbasin level in SWAT. 
Using ArcSWAT software, we created a slope grid within the same grid domain as our basin-wide DEM (900 m$^2$ resolution). 
The slopes for each subbasin were grouped into five quantile classes.
Each class contained approximately equal numbers of grid cells whose value fell within the range of values of each bin. 
These bins in degrees were 0.0--0.5, 0.5--1.5, 1.5--3.0, 3.0--5.8, and $>$ 5.8 
(or, in percent, 0--0.87, 0.87--2.62, 2.62--5.24, 5.24--10.2 and $>$ 10.2).
