	\caption{Soil attributes used in SWAT and the methods used to cluster SSURGO map units. The listed soil attributes are all soil properties used in SWAT. Not all these properties were used to cluster soil map units. The aggregation method is the aggregation function used to simplify the properties used in the clustering algorithm. Also listed are the original tables where the soil properties are located in SSURGO.}
