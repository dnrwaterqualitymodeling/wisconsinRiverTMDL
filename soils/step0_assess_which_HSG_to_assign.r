# SOME of the mapunits in the SSURGO database have two designations for hydrologic soil group, these 
# are A/D, B/D, and C/D, the former assuming the land is drained, and the latter assuming that the 
# soil is not drained. The SWAT soils database assumes that all of the soils are drained and there-
# fore assumes the not D option. 
#     This script looks at each of those mapunits with dual HSGs and examines the amound of cropland
# within the polygon. We (A. Ruesch and D. Evans) that if an area contains 50% or more agriculutral
# land (as defined by CDL) then it can be assumed to be drained. We found that NONE of those sites 
# that have two HSG designations in the WR basin have greater than 50% agland within. Thus all of the
# MUKEYs were updated with the D designation.
